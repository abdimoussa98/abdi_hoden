# rules: 

    15 min @ start we review previous problem

    30min timeblock -> discussion -> view code solution -> watch video explanation

    everyday end on looking at a new problem, so that we are leaving the call thinking about a solution

    given not timeblocking, 30min before end of call, if one problem isn't solved stop and watch solution
